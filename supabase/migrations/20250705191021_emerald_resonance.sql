## Testing Methodology

### 1. Information Gathering
Information gathering is the foundation of any security assessment. This phase involves collecting as much information as possible about the target application.

#### Passive Reconnaissance
- **DNS Enumeration**: Discover subdomains and DNS records
- **Search Engine Reconnaissance**: Use Google dorking and Shodan
- **Social Media Intelligence**: Gather information from social platforms
- **Public Records**: Check certificate transparency logs

```bash
# DNS enumeration
dig target.com ANY
nslookup target.com

# Subdomain discovery
subfinder -d target.com
amass enum -d target.com
```

#### Active Reconnaissance
- **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports and services
- **Service Enumeration**: Determine service versions and configurations
- **Technology Stack Identification**: Identify frameworks, databases, and server technologies

```bash
# Port scanning
nmap -sC -sV -oA target target.com

# Web technology identification
whatweb target.com
wappalyzer target.com
```

### 2. Authentication Testing
Authentication mechanisms are often the first line of defense and a common target for attackers.

#### Username Enumeration
- Test for user enumeration vulnerabilities
- Check error messages for information disclosure
- Analyze response times and status codes

#### Password Security
- **Brute Force Testing**: Test for weak passwords and account lockout
- **Password Policy Analysis**: Evaluate password complexity requirements
- **Default Credentials**: Check for default usernames and passwords

```bash
# Brute force testing
hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Invalid"

# Custom wordlist generation
cewl target.com -w wordlist.txt
```

#### Session Management
- **Session Token Analysis**: Evaluate randomness and entropy
- **Session Fixation**: Test for session fixation vulnerabilities
- **Session Timeout**: Verify proper session expiration

### 3. Authorization Testing
